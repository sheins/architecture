                                    <li>Organized by section of site or type of asset? Probably both, but in what order…`app/about/css` vs. `app/css/about</li>
                                    <!-- Emphasize it doesn't matter what you choose, as long as it's consistent -->

                        - Single responsibility principle - a term that is used in all aspects of code, from changing colors of links in CSS to making a footer that appears on every page.
                        - You have a website, and the navigation bar appears on every page. You're not going to rebuild that navigation bar at the top of every HTML file you create, you're going to make a module/component file, called something like nav.html, and then tell your code to include that on every page.
                        - Why? A) copying and pasting that much will give you carpel tunnel. B) Hard to maintain - if the client wants to change what links are in their nav bar, you'd have to edit every HTML file with the navigation. Things change in programming all the time in ways you wouldn't expect, this makes it easier to make those changes in the future
                        -Frustrating to work on "legacy code" that wasn't well thought out. Hard to locate bugs and squash them entirely without modularity. If you jump into a project and the nav bar is set up where you have to edit it on every page, and you miss a page, there's a bug floating around.

                    Documentation - Helps developers who are new to the project hit the ground running. What's the project about? What are the naming conventions?

                    Naming conventions - will you name your pages "blog.html" or "blog-page.html"? Things seem insignificant when you first start a project, but once you have a 30 different folders that are all named differently a year down the road, it will cause a lot of confusion

                    Build tools - Help simplify and automate the process.

                        - Yeoman is like a personal assistant. It'll do the boring tasks such as setting up folders and preprocessors for you. But like any good assistant, it'll need exact information in order to properly complete it's task. That's where generators come in.
                        - Generators are different project structures, called scaffolding, in a variety of lanuages created by other developers. There are currently over 4,000 different generators in the Yeoman to choose from. You can even create your own!
                        - Yeoman is an npm install, which means that node and npm need to be downloaded on your computer in order to use Yeoman.
                        - We talked about npm last month, but if you missed it, you can review the presentation at the coding and cocktails website.
                        - Start working with Yeoman using the yo command in your command line.

                        - Since we are going to be creating a web app, we'll be making our new project using the generator called Fountain Webapp. Each generator comes with it's own features depending on the langauage. We'll talk about Fountain Webapp's features in the next slider.

                        - Our generator does a lot of cool things for us. As you go through your new project, you'll see that the file structure Sara talked about has been created for us.
                        - Also, if you are using cool CSS3 functionalities like transitions and animations, webapp will automatically add the prefixes needed to make them work with all browsers.
                        - It will also compile your SASS file. SASS is a CSS preprocessor that allows developers to use variables and logic in their css. By compiling your SASS automatically, it makes those css variables and logic readable to the browser.
                        - Javascript not working? Webapp will lint your script, showing you the exact line where the problem is occuring and providing tips on best practices.
                        - As part of our project, a tool called Gulp has been installed. By running the gulp server, it will automatically reload your project each time you make a change to the css. You'll no longer have to press the reload button to see your changes. Gulp also helps with image optimization and css minifying, which will help your webite load super fast and create a great experience for visitors.
                        - There are many other things that Gulp can do so feel free to check out the website to learn more!

                        - To see the project you are working on, you'll need to run npm run serve. This is a server that will be running in the background while you are making changes to the project and updating the files that you are changing accordingly.
                        - Once you are ready to push your new site live, the npm run build command will use the css you've added and minify it into a smaller file that is difficult to humans to read but allows the browser to run the file faster.
                        - Sometimes things go wrong during the minification process, which is why you should run the npm run serve:dist command. This command will show you how your site will look when it is live using the minified files.
                        - If you need help with Yeoman or the generator you can run the command yo help or yo and the name of your generator.
                        - If you are using yeoman and running into errors you don't understand, you can run yo doctor and that command will troubleshoot issues for you and give you recommendations on how to solve it, such as updating npm or updating yeoman.
